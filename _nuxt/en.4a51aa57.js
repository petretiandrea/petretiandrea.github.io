const e={welcome:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:"Hello!"}},about_me:{t:0,b:{t:2,i:[{t:3}],s:`I'm Andrea Petreti, Software Engineer at PagoPA S.p.A.
      
I got my bachelor degree in Applied Informatics at Urbino University; 
later I decided to deepen my studies with a master degree in 
Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Bologna (at Cesena). 
During this last path I decided to focus on the world of software engineering; 
I love the quality of the code. 
The course of study also allowed me to acquire skills related to 
Computer Vision both through traditional techniques and through machine learning. 
Iâ€™m particularly passionate about the world related to IoT, 
robotics and artificial intelligence.
I enjoy any challenge related to the IT world.
