welcome: Hello!
about_me: |
  I'm Andrea Petreti, Software Engineer at PagoPA S.p.A.
        
  I got my bachelor degree in Applied Informatics at Urbino University; 
  later I decided to deepen my studies with a master degree in 
  Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Bologna (at Cesena). 
  During this last path I decided to focus on the world of software engineering; 
  I love the quality of the code. 
  The course of study also allowed me to acquire skills related to 
  Computer Vision both through traditional techniques and through machine learning. 
  Iâ€™m particularly passionate about the world related to IoT, 
  robotics and artificial intelligence.
  I enjoy any challenge related to the IT world.
