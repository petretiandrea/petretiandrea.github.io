# Hello
Welcome to my blog!

This blog will serve two purposes: first, as a personal agenda to keep track of design patterns, strategies, and the thought process behind various technical decisions. Second, it will act as a platform to share these insights with others who might benefit from or challenge my ideas.

The focus here will be on architectural design, with a particular emphasis on systems that are both highly scalable and resilient.

With experience in Quarkus, Spring Boot, Node.js, and a growing interest in Go, most of the solutions Iâ€™ll share will be based on these technologies.
