Passionate Software Engineer with a focus on \textbf{high-scalability systems} and \textbf{domain-driven design}. I love in designing architectures that handle heavy traffic and complex transactions. I love programming languages and high abstraction provided by them. My approach to new technologies or problems is \textbf{to go deep} until I understand and solve them. This allows me to satisfy my curiosity and improve myself, basically I'm a \textbf{proactive learner}. I love the quality of the code, improving existing system from both code and architectural side. My background in mobile development, cloud computing, and microservices enables me to tackle diverse technical challenges while remaining committed to code quality and performance. I enjoy any challenge related to the IT world.
